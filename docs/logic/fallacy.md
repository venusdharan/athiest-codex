# Logical Fallacies

## Formal

A formal fallacy is defined as an error that can be seen within the argument's form. Every formal fallacy is a non sequitur (or, an argument where the conclusion does not follow from the premise.)

### Bad Reason Fallacy

The bad reasons fallacy stems from the claim that because the reason(s) given for a certain conclusion are bad therefore the conclusion must also be incorrect. This fallacy supposes that it is not possible to give a bad reason for a correct conclusion. In fact, it is possible to give bad reasoning for a valid conclusion.

Fallacy formula:

- The reason A given for argument B is bad, therefore conclusion B is not valid

**Example of Bad Reason Fallacy**

- Dogs are afraid of heights, therefore dogs don't fly. 

*Though it may be true that dogs are afraid of heights, that is not the reason why they do not fly.*

- Ostrich cannot fly, therefore they are not birds. 

*It is true that ostrich cannot fly, but they are in fact birds.*

**Note**

The reason is true, but it does not lead to the conclusion being drawn.

### Propositional Fallacies

A propositional fallacy is one where an error in logic takes place due to compound propositions--a proposition is a 'statement'. In order for a compound proposition to have a true value, each component proposition must also be true.


Logic formulas: 

- Affirming a disjunct: A or B; A; therefore not B
- Affirming the consequent: A, then B; B, therefore A
- Denying the antecedent: If A, then B; not A, therefore not B 

**Example of Propositional Fallacies**

- William Shatner is Captain Kirk or he is in Miss Congeniality. William Shatner is in Miss Congeniality. Therefore he is not Captain Kirk. 

*It is possible for William Shatner to be in both of these movies (in fact he was).*

- I am going to bed or reading a book. I feel really tired tonight, so I will go to bed. So, I cannot read. 

*It is possible to go to bed, as well as read a book.*

### Quantification Fallacies

Error in logic where the quantifiers of the premises are in contradiction to the conclusions quantifiers. An example of such a fallcy is when the argument has a universal premise and a particular conclusion. That is, the premise(s) do not justify the conclusion(s).

The most important quantifiers are:

- Universal Quantifier: All x
- Existential Quantifier: Some x 

**Example of Quantification Fallacies**

- All dogs hate some cats.

*This is an impossible claim to validate. It may be the case that some some dogs hate some cats, but it would be impossible to determine whether or not all dogs hate only some cats.*

- Financial experts agree that everyone should invest in technology stocks. 

*This statement implies that all financial experts agree, which may not be the case.*

### Syllogistic Fallacies

When logical fallacies occur in the syllogisms of deductive reasoning. This occurs with a reference to something general, and then makes a conclusion about something more specific.

Definition of a categorical syllogism is an argument with two premises: one syllogism and one conclusion.

- A: All S are P. (Ex. All dogs are mammals.)
- E: No S are P. (Ex. No cats are fish.)
- I: Some S are P. (Some logicians are philosophers.)
- O: Some S are not P. (Some men are not clowns.)

**Example of Syllogistic Fallacies**

- All sharks are fish (All S are P.)
  All salmon are fish (All x are P). 
  Therefore all salmon are sharks. (All x are P.)

*The two generalities in the first two statements are true, but they do not validate the conclusion being drawn.*

- No philosophers are elephants.
  All elephants are mammals.
  Therefore no philosophers are mammals.

*Though it is true that there are no philosophers that are elephants, and that all elephants are in fact mammals. These do not negate the fact that philosophers (humans) are mammals.*

**Note**

Alternative Name: Fallacy of the Undistributed Middle

## Informal

### Ad Hominem Fallacy

The ad hominem attack is a logical fallacy associated with trying to undermine the opponent's arguments by personal attacks, through attacking their character or skill level, etc. The ad hominem attack uses an accepted fact about a person to undermine their credibility despite the lack of causal connection between the two parts of the argument

**Example of Ad Hominem**

- Bill claims that this was an accident, but we know Bill to be a liar, so we can't take his word for it. 
*Even though Bill may be a liar, his character does not automatically make anything he says untrue.*

- Susan is an avid hunter, therefor she cannot possibly support gun control. 
*Being a hunter is used as a negative characteristic to make a conclusion which could very well be untrue. Susan could support a variety of gun control elgislation.* 

**Note**

Short for: Argumentum Ad Hominem

### Ambiguity Fallacy

The fallacy of ambiguity refers to the use of a double meaning or an unclear descriptive applied to mislead or misrepresent the truth. Then changing the meaning of the terms later.

**Example of Ambiguity**

- Bill Clinton's "I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky." 

*He later redefined the term "sexual relations" in the broad categorical understanding of that word, as opposed to the specific aspect which he was guilty of.*

- know John very well. He would never do 'x'. 

*The 'know very well' is a vague claim, which cannot be readily verified.*

**Note**

- Alternative Name: Hedging
- Ambiguity is a fallacious argument often used by politicians.

### Anecdotal Fallacy

The anecdotal fallacy uses a personal experience or an isolated example instead of a sound argument.

**Example of Anecdotal**

- Leanne thinks smoking does not affect life expectancy since her grandmother smoked for 4 decades and lived to be 87. 

*The fact that Leanne's grandmother's smoking did not result in cancer or other kind of disease, does not mean that someone else with the same behavior would have had the same result.*

- I have never seen a happy marriage. Getting married is a bad idea. 

*Even though the speaker has only seen unhappy marriages, it does not mean that there are no happy marriages and that people should avoid getting married.*

### Appeal to Authority Fallacy

The fallacy of appeal to authority makes the argument that if one credible source believes something that it must be true.

**Example of Appeal to Authority**

- If the Pope says that an aspect of doctrine is true, then it should be added to the creed, since he is infallible.

- The mayor said that the crime rate is down. The statistics claiming otherwise must be erroneous.

*Since the mayor is in charge of the city and supposedly aware of the goings on his statement should supersede statistical data.*

### Appeal to Emotion Fallacy

The fallacy of appeal to emotion makes a claim based on sympathy or empathetic instead of just or logical grounds.

**Example of Appeal to Emotion**

- Sarah did not want to eat liverwurst for dinner, but he mother told her to think of all the starving children in the world who do not have food at all.

*Sarah eating (or not eating) her food has no bearing on starving children in another part of the world.*

- Almost every commercial is an appeal to emotion. A cereal commercial shows kids enjoying their breakfast with a happy mom in the background.

*The commercial is supposed to make parents think that if they get this cereal their kids will just sit down and have their breakfast without running around and driving them crazy.*

### Appeal to Nature Fallacy

The fallacy of appeal to nature refers to the argument that just because something is natural that it is therefore valid, justified, or inevitable.

**Example of Appeal to Nature**

- "John was well within his rights to avenge his wife after he witnessed her being brutally murdered. Killing the murderer was the natural response."

- Product packaging that claims 'natural' ingredients is an appeal to nature fallacy. There are many naturally occurring poisons which would be harmful if ingested.

### Appeal to Ridicule Fallacy

Appeal to Ridicule is an informal fallacy which claims an argument to be ridiculous or absurd. The fallacy uses this claim in an attempt to invalidate the argument since it is not worth entertaining.

Appeal to ridicule can be used in conjunction with other fallacies such as appeal to emotion. Sarcasm can also be used as a means of appeal to ridicule.

**Example of Appeal to Ridicule**

- Everyone should wear seatbelts. We should also wear bibs and sleep in a bassinet.

- Why should I support the 2nd Amendment, do I look like toothless hick?

### Appeal to Tradition Fallacy

As the name suggest this fallacy relies on tradition to prove a point, arguing that a thesis must be correct because it has traditionally been so (we?ve always done it this way).

**Example of Appeal to Tradition**

- "Everyone in our family has attended the University of California system, so you must do the same."

- The death penalty is acceptable because it has always been the means with which haenous crime has been punished.

### Argument from Repetition Fallacy

Argument from repetition refers to someone repeating a statement often in the hopes that the listener will begin to accept it as truth, instead of providing evidence.

**Example of Argument from Repetition**

- Hurtlocker deserves an Oscar. Other films have potential, but they do not deserve an Oscar like Hurtlocker does. The other movies may deserve an honorable mention but Hurtlocker deserves the Oscar.

*The argument basically claims that the Hurt Locker is a great movie because it is a great movie.*

- Stupid people are so annoying. They prove their stupidity by saying stupid things.

**Note**

Alternative Name: Argumentum ad Nauseam

### Argumentum ad Populum

Also known as 'appealing to the people', this fallacy presumes that a proposition must be true because most/many believe it to be true.

**Example of Argumentum ad Populum**

- Extended warranties are a very popular purchase by the consumer, so extended warranties must be good for the consumer.

*The fact that something is popular has no bearing on whether it is beneficial.*

- Everyone drives over the speed limit, so it should not be against the law.

*Just because a lot of people do something, it does not make it the right thing to do.*

### Bandwagon Fallacy

The fallacy of bandwagon says, 'But everyone is doing it.' This fallacy appeal to the popularity of something as a means of validating it.

**Example of Bandwagon**

- A recent study shows 8 out of 10 doctors say that acupuncture is an effective therapy, therefore it must be true since 8 out of 10 doctors can't be wrong!

*Agreement among experts does not necessarily lead to a true outcome.*

- Everyone else is going to attend a four-year university, so I am going to do the same instead of taking classes at a local community college.

*Doing something because everyone else is doing it is not a logically valid reason for taking part in something*

### Begging the Question Fallacy

Begging the question presents circular arguments in which the conclusion is included in the premise of the argument.

**Example of Begging the Question**

- Opium is known to put people to sleep because it contains soporific properties.

*This is the same as saying "Opium puts people to sleep because it has elements that put people to sleep."*

- Stocks are the best investment since every other investment is an inferior option.

*There is no explanation given as to why other investments are inferior.*

**Notes**

Alternative Name: Petitio Principii

### Burden of Proof Fallacy

This fallacy originates from the Latin phrase "onus probandi incumbit ei qui dicit, non ei qui negat"). The burden of proof is on the person who makes the claim, not on the person who denies (or questions) the claim. The fallacy of the Burden of Proof occurs when someone who is making a claim, puts the burden of proof on another party to disprove what they are claiming.

**Example of Burden of Proof**

- Ellis: "I believe that fairies exists."
Marty: "How can you prove it?
Ellis: "I don't have to, if you can't prove that fairies don't exist."

*This type of argument puts the burden of proof on the other person.*

- An employee claims harassment without proof, and argues that the employer cannot prove that she was not harassed.

*The employer has no way of disproving that the employee did not get harassed.*

**Notes**

Alternative Name: Onus Probandi

### Circular Reasoning Fallacy

The fallacy of circular logic occurs when the one reasoning begins with a claim they are trying to conclude with.

**Example of Circular Reasoning**

- Whatever is less dense than water will float, because such objects won't sink in water.
- Women should be able to have abortions, so abortion should be legal and easily available.

**Notes**

Alternative Name: Circulus in Demonstrando

### Continuum Fallacy

Also called the fallacy of the beard, line-drawing fallacy, fallacy of the heap, the sorites fallacy, and the bald man fallacy, the continuum fallacy rejects a claim because it is not precise. The is fallacious because, vague, "in-between" or unclear scenarios do not make them necessarily untrue.

**Example of Continuum Fallacy**

- Ronnie has a full head of hair. If you pull one out, he will not be bald. If you pull another out, he still will not be bald. So no matter how many hairs you pull out, Ronnie will not be bald.

*This is untrue since at some point Ronnie will run out of hair.*

- I've been able to swim across any body of water I've come across, so there is no body of water I would not be able to swim across.

*Given a large enough body of water, crossing it by swimming will be impossible.*

### Equivocation Fallacy

The fallacy of equivocation uses misleading terms of more than one meaning without clarifying which definition is intended in the scenario.

**Example of Equivocation**

- Philosophy students are taught how to argue, but shouldn't we teach them something more helpful? After all there are already a lot of arguments and conflicts in the world.

*The term argue/argument is being used with different meanings.*

- Claiming someone is unethical because they have bad worth ethics

*The word unethical/ethics have two different meanings in this conflict.*

### Etymological Fallacy

The etymological fallacy poses that a certain term's original meaning applies to its colloquial and modern understanding in current circumstances.

**Example of Etymological Fallacy**

- "Lucy, why do you call your children 'kids?' Don't you see how offensive it is to liken your children to immature little goats?"

*The word for baby goats is 'kid'. The speaker is arguing that 'kid' can only refer to baby goats.*

- Calling someone (a straight person) who is happy and jolly 'gay' and insisting that only the old meaning of 'gay' is valid.

*'Gay' used to mean 'happy'.*

### Fallacy Fallacy

This is an an argument that is based on false claims, but is logically coherent.

**Example of Fallacy Fallacy**

- Jenna thinks we should do yoga before work because it is natural and is said to relax you. Miles thinks we should also smoke pot before work for the same reasons.

- Whenever it rains, the sky is cloudy. The sky is cloudy now, so it must be raining

*It is possible for the sky to be cloudy but not to be raining.*

### Fallacy of Composition and Division

The fallacy of composition and division makes the assumption that one part of something will apply to the whole, or that the whole must apply to all the parts.

**Example of Fallacy of Composition and Division**

- **Composition**: Each part of this chair is cheap, so the whole chair for sale must be cheap.

- **Division**: Healthy brains think. Healthy brains are comprised of nothing but brain cells. If healthy brains think, then the individual brain cells can think too.

### Fallacy of Quoting Out of Context

Also known as contextomy, the fallacy of quoting out of context occurs when an original phrase is distorted or a claim is misconstrued from its original meaning, by quoting it out of context.

**Example of Fallacy of Quoting Out of Context**

"One of the finest things ever done by a mob was the crucifixion of Christ. You see what I would have done is shipped him to Rome and fed him to the lions. They could never have made a savior out of mince meat."- Ben Hecht.

*This is an example of contextomy because the excerpt is from a novel and spoken by a fictional character. Thus quoting this section as if it was an opinion held by the author Ben Hecht, is not an accurate reflection of the author's personal beliefs, but rather of the character who spoke it in his novel.*

### False Cause & False Attribution

False cause refers to an argument where someone cites sequential events as evidence that the first event caused the second. False attribution happens when someone appeals to irrelevant, biased, or unqualified information.

**Example of False Cause & False Attribution**

- **False Cause**: I eat bananas for a snack every day. One day I skipped my banana, and my car was broken into. I have not missed a day of banana-snacking since.

- **False Attribution**: John showed me this book that proved scientists have empirical evidence for the existence of mermaids, but I lost the book and don't remember the title.

### False Dilemma

Also called false dichotomy, fallacy of bifurcation, black-or-white fallacy, the false delamma presents two alternative states as the only possibilities when more possibilities may exist.

**Example of False Dilemma**

- You are either with me or against me.
- Either you buy me this toy, or you don't love me. (Child saying to a parent)

### Furtive Fallacy

Furtive fallacy occurs when the outcomes seem to have been caused by the malfeasance of the decision makers involved.

**Example of Furtive Fallacy**

- This is most evident in when historians or scientists write articles at great lengths in description of the lives of certain personages, or events for which there is not sufficient evidence to prove the claims. The argument being made is not only without foundation, it is made with certainty (to further a point/agenda).

### Gambler's Fallacy

The gambler's fallacy is based on the false belief that separate, independent events can affect the likelihood of another random event, or that if something happens often that it is less likely that the same will take place in the future.

**Example of Gambler's Fallacy**

- Edna had rolled a 6 with the dice the last 9 consecutive times. Surely it would be highly unlikely that she would roll another 6 on the 10th time.

*The previous rolls have no bearing on the next roll of the dice.*

- My sister's first three children have been girls. The fourth one is sure to be a boy

*The chances of the fourth baby being a boy are 50/50*

### Genetic Fallacy

The genetic fallacy reasons that one can accurately judge or assess something as good or bad based on where it originates from.

**Example of Genetic Fallacy**

- I was brought up Mormon, so I believe Mormonism is the truth, since my parents are good people and they wouldn't lie to me.

- My physician is overweight. I can't trust any of his health advice.


### Ignoratio Elenchi

Also called Irrelevant Conclusion, the ignoratio elenchi fallacy reaches a relevant conclusion but misses the point. Though the claims and conclusion may be logically valid, they do not address the point in question.

**Example of Ignoratio Elenchi**

- Hippos can't be dangerous to humans, because they are so calm and look so cute.

*Proving an irrelevant conclusion. Also interesting to note, that of all animals, hippos cause the highest number of human deaths in Africa.*

- The President's policies on healthcare may be popular, but he is secretly a Nazi and should probably be investigated.

*The tax policy and whether or not the president is a Nazi have nothing to do with one another.*

### Incomplete Comparison

An incomplete comparison occurs when two things are compared that are not really related, in order to make something more appealing than it is. This also happens when conclusions are made with incomplete information.

### Inflation of Conflict

The fallacy of inflation of conflict assumes the belief that the instances where scholars and scientists have differing opinions on the something, it calls the credibility of the entire field into question.

### Kettle Logic

Kettle logic is the use of several inconsistent arguments to defend a position.

**Example of Kettle Logic**

- Someone accused of having sex in a public place might respond with an argument that they were not having sex in a public place, since the restroom was in a park, in a secluded location and the stall blocked them from public view.

- Someone caught speeding argues that:
I was not speeding.
I didn't see the speed limit sign
There was no speed limit posted. 

**Note**

The term Kettle Logic was first used by Sigmund Freud. He explained it as part of a story about a man accused of having damaged a kettle. 

The man gave three defenses:

- I returned the kettle undamaged.
- The kettle was already damaged when I borrowed it.
- I never borrowed the kettle.

Each of the defenses by the man could be potentially valid, but all of them consider together make the defense questionable.

### Loaded Question

The loaded question arises by asking a question that presupposes a claim so that it cannot be answered to without sounding guilty.

**Example of Loaded Question**

- "Marijuana has mind-numbing elements that affect your memory so how can you say you have never had marijuana if you can't remember? Now exactly how much pot did you smoke?"

*The inability to remember could be caused by variety of other things instead of smoking marijuana.*

- "Do you think the President should be impeached for colluding with foreign powers?"

*Whether the respondant says 'yes' or 'no' the question establishes the 'fact' that the President colluded with foreign powers. The only question that remains is whether he should be impeached.*

### Middle Ground

The middle ground fallacy argues that a compromise between two extremes must be reached to satisfy a situation.

**Example of Middle Ground**

- Joe says the sky is pink and Liz says the sky is blue, so they should really just compromise and say the sky is purple.

- Dan says that all elephants can fly. Sara says that there are no elephants that can fly. So they agree that perhaps some elephants can fly.

*Compromising for the sake of compromise when there are indisputable facts being presented would be considered a middle ground fallacy.*

**Note**

- The middle ground fallacy claims that since compromising is good, in any given situation the compromise will produce truth.

- Alternative Names: Argument to moderation (Latin: argumentum ad temperantiam), false equivalence, false compromise, equidistance fallacy, the golden mean fallacy


### No True Scotsman

The no true Scotsman fallacy appeals to the "purity" of an ideal or standard as a way to dismiss relevant criticisms or flaws in your argument.

**Example of No True Scotsman**

- John doesn't drink alcohol. No real man avoids alcohol. John isn't a real man

*The argument creates an ideal man, and uses it to prove a point.*

- Sarah always wears slacks. No real woman would wear slacks. Sarah is not a real woman.

*'Establishing' that no real woman would wear slacks creates the fallacy.*


### Personal Incredulity

The fallacy of personal incredulity occurs when one finds a concept difficult to understand, or simply does not fathom how it works, then they conclude that it is likely untrue.

**Example of Personal Incredulity**

- Irene was 89 years old, had never left the small town in Iowa where she was raised, and she had never seen a sea vessel. Though Michael had tried to describe what Navy life on the submarine would be like, she didn't believe a word was true. How could a glorified metal tube sustain the lives of many men, while submerged for months at a time?

- "It is not possible that we landed a man on the moon. How could a tiny capsule with relatively primitive computer technology travel millions of miles in space, travel through radiation, avoid space debris, land and then make the return journy unharmed?"


### Proof by Verbosity

Also called argumentum verbosium, or proof by intimidation, proof by verbosity is an argument that is far too complicated and verbose for an opponent to reasonably address all the particulars, or the person making the argument is so well-reputed that one takes his claims as truth.

**Example of Proof by Verbosity**

- Dr. Samuel Donovan solved a Rubik's Cube in 45 seconds; he won the Medal of Honor for his service in Vietnam, had given lectures across the world in microbiology, and was awarded a Pulitzer Prize; so I don't doubt that his claim is true about the egg coming before the chicken.

- The professor, through the most elloquent of words, and the most beautiful prose devined the conclusion that one plus one equals three. This highly impressive display of mastry over language and oratory skill proves that one plus one equals three.

*No amount of flowery language can prove that one plus one is anything other than two.*

### Proving Too Much

The fallacy of proving too much refers to an argument that reaches a conclusions which contradicts things that are known to be true, or contradicts the premises in that argument.

**Example of Proving Too Much**

- One might argue that "all slavery is evil because there are cases where a slave was beaten to death."

*This is proving too much, because the same logic would reason that since some cases of domestic violence exist, that all marriage is evil.*

- Fire is a bad thing because there are many fires which burn down property and cost lives.

*Fire when used properly and with necessary care is a great tool for humanity.*

### Red Herring

The red herring fallacy focuses on arguing for an irrelevant topic with the intention of distracting the audience, this usually happens when the orator finds another topic easier to outline.

**Example of Red Herring**

- "I know I cheated on the test, Mrs. Holburn. But what am I going to do, my parents will kill me!"

- "Officer, I was speeding. But I have to return this book to the library. I don't want to have to pay a late fee."

### Reification

Also called the Fallacy of Misplaced Concreteness, or hypostatization, the reification fallacy occurs when an argument relies on an abstract concept as if it were a concrete fact; when a hypothetical scenario or situation is referred to, and treated as if it were a real thing.

**Example of Reification**

- "The ocean is calling me saying 'Come play with me, and splash in the salty waves'."

*The ocean is not concious entity that can speak.*

- "He had to heed the call of Mother Nature and go live in the woods."

*'Mother Nature' is a philosophical construct and cannot 'call' anyone to do anything.*

**Note**

Alternative Names: Concretism, hypostatization, misplaced concreteness



### Retrospective Determinism

The fallacy of retrospective determinism argues that because something happened, it was inevitable.

**Example of Retrospective Determinism**

- When Hitler decided to invade Russia, it was game over for the Nazis. This was because there was no way German troupes could survive the Russian winter, or cope with the vastness of the country.

- It should have been obvious that Alexander the Great could not conquer all of Asia. It is impossible to make that journey and not fall ill.


### Shotgun Argumentation

The shotgun argumentation fallacy occurs when one chooses so many arguments, firing many shots as it were, in order to disable your opponent from answering them all.

**Example of Shotgun Argumentation**

- An angry sports fan might argue that his team lost because the lights were shut off in the middle of the game, and that the player in the forward position had a gimp knee so wasn't able to score as well, and that the refs kept yellow-carding the best players, and that there was a clear biased for the opposing team, so that is why they didn't win.

*Making several tangentially valid arguments does not result in a valid claim.*

- A student argues that he didn't do his homework because, he had lost his backpack, and when he found it the notebook was not in there, and it turned out that the dog had eaten his notebook.

### Slippery Slope

The slippery slope fallacy consists of arguments that reason if something S were to happen, then something else P will eventually occur, so we should prohibit S from happening.

**Example of Slippery Slope**

- If we let our child out of his room, eventually he will want to leave the house, and will end up on the street. If he is walking around on the street then he will be snatched up by a stranger and sold into slavery in a remote region on the World.

*Though it may be true that the child might leave the house and go on the street, but endin gup as a slave in a remote part of the world is comically unlikely.*

- If Donald Trump gets elected for a second term, he will show his true colors as a nazi dictator, abolish the U.S. democratic republic, and appoint himself as emperor.

### Special Pleading

The special pleading fallacy occurs when the orator ignores certain elements that are unhelpful for their claims, or when one asks for special considerations to be given them or one of their premises.

**Example of Special Pleading**

- "Yes, I know convicted drug abuse justifies imprisonment. But my son is a good kid, your honor, and just fell in with the wrong crowd."

*Though a mother's pleading may be heart wrenching, it is not a valid argument for letting a convicted drug offender out of prison.*

- "Officer, I know I was speeding, but I am headed to the hospital to visit a sick family member."


### Strawman

The strawman fallacy occurs when one misrepresents an argument so that it becomes easier to attack.

**Example of Strawman**

- Those who oppose abortion have no respect for women's rights, and see women as baby-making machines, which is of course wrong. Women must be able to choose.

- People who oppose gun control are potential terrorists. We cannot allow terrorists to decide our laws. All guns should be banned.

### Texas Sharpshooter

The Texas sharpshooter fallacy occurs when a speaker chooses a cluster of data to apply to their argument, or when they find a pattern that they can apply to a presumption.

**Example of Texas Sharpshooter**

- A recent study showed that the top 10 countries where Italian soda is most commonly consumed are also countries that have some of the lowest rankings in reported cases of depression. Therefore Italian soda makes people happy.

*Though there may be a correlation between the two, that does not necessarily mean causation.*

- There are some measurements which could be used to conclude that there is global warming happening. But other information and statistics which contradict those results are ignored.

### Tu Quoque

Tu quoque is a fallacy answering criticism with criticism, or turning the argument back around on the other person. It also applied the logic that because someone has done something, that it justifies someone else doing the same thing.

**Example of Tu Quoque**

- The Ancient Greeks were some of the greatest thinkers. They had slaves, so we should have slaves too.

- Jason: You cheated on your test. Don't you know that is wrong?
David: Didn't you cheat on your test last year?

**Note**

Alternative Name: The two wrong fallacy

### Sunk Cost Fallacy

The Sunk Cost Fallacy describes our tendency to follow through on an endeavor if we have already invested time, effort, or money into it, whether or not the current costs outweigh the benefits.

### Cherry picking

Cherry picking, suppressing evidence, or the fallacy of incomplete evidence is the act of pointing to individual cases or data that seem to confirm a particular position while ignoring a significant portion of related and similar cases or data that may contradict that position.
