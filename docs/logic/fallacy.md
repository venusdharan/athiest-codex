# Logical Fallacies

## Formal

A formal fallacy is defined as an error that can be seen within the argument's form. Every formal fallacy is a non sequitur (or, an argument where the conclusion does not follow from the premise.)

### Bad Reason Fallacy

The bad reasons fallacy stems from the claim that because the reason(s) given for a certain conclusion are bad therefore the conclusion must also be incorrect. This fallacy supposes that it is not possible to give a bad reason for a correct conclusion. In fact, it is possible to give bad reasoning for a valid conclusion.

Fallacy formula:

- The reason A given for argument B is bad, therefore conclusion B is not valid

**Example of Bad Reason Fallacy**

- Dogs are afraid of heights, therefore dogs don't fly. 

*Though it may be true that dogs are afraid of heights, that is not the reason why they do not fly.*

- Ostrich cannot fly, therefore they are not birds. 

*It is true that ostrich cannot fly, but they are in fact birds.*

**Note**

The reason is true, but it does not lead to the conclusion being drawn.

### Propositional Fallacies

A propositional fallacy is one where an error in logic takes place due to compound propositions--a proposition is a 'statement'. In order for a compound proposition to have a true value, each component proposition must also be true.


Logic formulas: 

- Affirming a disjunct: A or B; A; therefore not B
- Affirming the consequent: A, then B; B, therefore A
- Denying the antecedent: If A, then B; not A, therefore not B 

**Example of Propositional Fallacies**

- William Shatner is Captain Kirk or he is in Miss Congeniality. William Shatner is in Miss Congeniality. Therefore he is not Captain Kirk. 

*It is possible for William Shatner to be in both of these movies (in fact he was).*

- I am going to bed or reading a book. I feel really tired tonight, so I will go to bed. So, I cannot read. 

*It is possible to go to bed, as well as read a book.*

### Quantification Fallacies

Error in logic where the quantifiers of the premises are in contradiction to the conclusions quantifiers. An example of such a fallcy is when the argument has a universal premise and a particular conclusion. That is, the premise(s) do not justify the conclusion(s).

The most important quantifiers are:

- Universal Quantifier: All x
- Existential Quantifier: Some x 

**Example of Quantification Fallacies**

- All dogs hate some cats.

*This is an impossible claim to validate. It may be the case that some some dogs hate some cats, but it would be impossible to determine whether or not all dogs hate only some cats.*

- Financial experts agree that everyone should invest in technology stocks. 

*This statement implies that all financial experts agree, which may not be the case.*

### Syllogistic Fallacies

When logical fallacies occur in the syllogisms of deductive reasoning. This occurs with a reference to something general, and then makes a conclusion about something more specific.

Definition of a categorical syllogism is an argument with two premises: one syllogism and one conclusion.

- A: All S are P. (Ex. All dogs are mammals.)
- E: No S are P. (Ex. No cats are fish.)
- I: Some S are P. (Some logicians are philosophers.)
- O: Some S are not P. (Some men are not clowns.)

**Example of Syllogistic Fallacies**

- All sharks are fish (All S are P.)
  All salmon are fish (All x are P). 
  Therefore all salmon are sharks. (All x are P.)

*The two generalities in the first two statements are true, but they do not validate the conclusion being drawn.*

- No philosophers are elephants.
  All elephants are mammals.
  Therefore no philosophers are mammals.

*Though it is true that there are no philosophers that are elephants, and that all elephants are in fact mammals. These do not negate the fact that philosophers (humans) are mammals.*

**Note**

Alternative Name: Fallacy of the Undistributed Middle

### Ad Hominem

The ad hominem attack is a logical fallacy associated with trying to undermine the opponent's arguments by personal attacks, through attacking their character or skill level, etc. The ad hominem attack uses an accepted fact about a person to undermine their credibility despite the lack of causal connection between the two parts of the argument

**Example of Ad Hominem**

- Bill claims that this was an accident, but we know Bill to be a liar, so we can't take his word for it. 
*Even though Bill may be a liar, his character does not automatically make anything he says untrue.*

- Susan is an avid hunter, therefor she cannot possibly support gun control. 
*Being a hunter is used as a negative characteristic to make a conclusion which could very well be untrue. Susan could support a variety of gun control elgislation.* 

**Note**

Short for: Argumentum Ad Hominem

### Ambiguity

The fallacy of ambiguity refers to the use of a double meaning or an unclear descriptive applied to mislead or misrepresent the truth. Then changing the meaning of the terms later.

**Example of Ambiguity**

- Bill Clinton's "I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky." 

*He later redefined the term "sexual relations" in the broad categorical understanding of that word, as opposed to the specific aspect which he was guilty of.*

- know John very well. He would never do 'x'. 

*The 'know very well' is a vague claim, which cannot be readily verified.*

**Note**

- Alternative Name: Hedging
- Ambiguity is a fallacious argument often used by politicians.

### Anecdotal

The anecdotal fallacy uses a personal experience or an isolated example instead of a sound argument.

**Example of Anecdotal**

- Leanne thinks smoking does not affect life expectancy since her grandmother smoked for 4 decades and lived to be 87. 

*The fact that Leanne's grandmother's smoking did not result in cancer or other kind of disease, does not mean that someone else with the same behavior would have had the same result.*

- I have never seen a happy marriage. Getting married is a bad idea. 

*Even though the speaker has only seen unhappy marriages, it does not mean that there are no happy marriages and that people should avoid getting married.*
